# Book Rating

Simple application using React as frontend and Ruby On Rails as the API backend. The database is set for PostgreSQL. The current version of the API implements all the CRUD for the book creation, but haven't build the views yet.

## To-Do:

- User profiles
- Books publications and reviews must be owned by a user
- Views for the current API of the Book.

## Tools

- `Insomnia` for the API testing
- `VScode`
- Built on Debian Linux
- ruby 2.6.7p197
- node v14.17.0
- rails 6.1.3.1
